# Openwrt

## Supported Hardware

* [WNDR 3700,3800,3800ch](./AR71XX.md)
* [TPLink c2600](./TPLINK.md)

## Requirements

Make sure you have the prereq pkgs for the [Openwrt Image Builder](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/additional-software/imagebuilder)

To use this part of the git repo you will need the following pkgs:
  - git >= 1.8.2
  - git-lfs
  - gomplate >= 3.2.0
  - Docker (Optional)

### Gomplate

Installation of `gomplate` is a little bit tricky since it doesnt come in a `.deb`:
```bash
sudo -i
cd /usr/local/bin/
curl -O https://github.com/hairyhenderson/gomplate/releases/download/<version>/gomplate_linux-amd64 -L
mv gomplate_linux-amd64 gomplate
```

### Docker

You can build these openwrt images inside a docker container. This makes it easy to has a consistent build environment
for all members of the tech team.

To start building:

```
docker pull sarcasticadmin/openwrt-build:2aea1a2
# Make sure to mount the git root inside this container
docker run -v $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel):/home/openwrt/scale-network --rm -it sarcasticadmin/openwrt-build:2aea1a2 /bin/bash
cd /home/openwrt/scale-network
```
> There is no latest tag so make sure to specify the version (short commit hash)
> The docker mount only works in linux, on OSX you'll get: "Build dependency: OpenWrt can only be built on a case-sensitive filesystem"

Then continue onto whichever image you'd like to build.

## Build

### Image No Templates

Build are done per arch with `TARGET` environment variable (defaults to `TARGET=ar71xx`:

```sh
cd ./openwrt
make build-img
```
> This requires an internet connection since it downloads the Openwrt src
> github.com and uses some openwrt mirrors.

You will find the images in `./build/source-<commit>/bin/targets/<target>/generic/`
The `*sysupgrade.bin` and `*factory.img` files match the AP models

### Image with Templates

To get the configuration thats used at scale the templates need to be baked into
the image.

Copy over the default secrets:
```bash
cp ./facts/secrets/openwrt-example.yaml ./facts/secrets/openwrt.yaml
```
> If needed update the defaults in `openwrt.yaml` to represent actual values

Generate and update the root password hash in `openwrt.yaml`:
```bash
openssl passwd -1 secretpassword
```

Compile the templates:
```bash
cd ./openwrt/
make templates
```
> This will populate the templates with the necessary values and
> prep them in the build dir. To validate the templates check:
> ./openwrt/build/source-<commit>/files/

Now build the image:
```
make build-img
```

This will populate the templates with the necessary values and include them
into the Openwrt build

## Misc

### Adding new packages

Leverage the existing `diffconfig` via the `Makefile`:
```
make config
cd build/source-<SHA>/
make menuconfig
```

At this point you can add any additional pkgs youd like. Afterwhich its time
to save them back to the `diffconfig` using the makefile and then copy them
to the commonconfig:
```
make diffconfig commonconfig
```

At which point you should have a diff in git which can then be tested against a new
build of the img

### Updating target info

This is similar to `Adding a new package` however after running `menuconfig` go back to the Makefile in `openwrt`
and run:
```
make diffconfig targetconfig
```

### Identity

Depending on the SCaLE conference number, the WPS LED will be ON for even years and OFF
for odd years.
> NOTE: This depends on the SCaLE conference number from `facts.yaml` not the year since the build
> would drift based on when it was built.

## Notes

### Issues

1. When iterating on new packages there have been times were the existing config is stale
and needs to be completely blown away and regenerated off of `master` then reconfigured
with `menuconfig`. This is just something to be aware of since its come up during the development
of this image.

### SSH

1. `/root` - Must be permissions `755` (or less perm) or ssh-key auth wont work
2. openssh needs to have both `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/hosts` to allow ssh login

### Useful commands

To check which vlans are loaded onto a switch:

```sh
swconfig dev switch0 show
```

Check to see the status of the wifi radios:

```sh
wifi status
```
